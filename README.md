# social_asocial_condorcet
Here is my replication of: "Phase coexistence in a forecasting game", Philippe Curty and Matteo Marsili J.Stat.Mech. (2006)

This model is an expansion of Condorcet Jury theorem. It neatly shows how frequency-dependency theoretically predicts social learning to have no advantage compared to asocial learning (an example of Rogers paradox). Furthermore, by plotting the reward at the level of the group, we can see that the evolutionary stable startegy does not maximises group level-outocme (so long for capitalism). I added the basic evolutionary analysis.
