# social_asocial_condorcet
Here is my replication of: "Phase coexistence in a forecasting game", Philippe Curty and Matteo Marsili J.Stat.Mech. (2006)

This model is an expansion of Condorcet Jury theorem. It neatly shows how frequency-dependency theoretically predicts social learning to have no advantage compared to asocial learning (an example of Rogers paradox). Furthermore, as seen from a basic evolutionary analysis, the evolutionary stable startegy does not maximise group level-outcome.
